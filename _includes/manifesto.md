1.  **_#radicallyopen_** We value openness above all.
    We will work in the open where possible.
2.  **Think big, deliver fast.** We're not a big consultancy,
    so we won't do what they do. We use agile approaches to
    deliver often.
3.  **Delivery trumps documentation.** We'd rather give you a
    working prototype. We won't produce endless documentation
    telling you what we're going to do.
4.  **Just enough governance.** We value processes that ensure
    successful delivery and organisational buy-in.
