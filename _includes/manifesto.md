## Our manifesto

1.  **Radically open.** We value openness above all.
    We will work in the open where possible.
2.  **Think big, deliver fast.** We use agile approaches to
    deliver frequent working increments to move you towards
    your desintation.
3.  **Delivery trumps documentation.** We'd rather give you a
    working product. We won't produce endless documentation
    telling you what we're going to do.
4.  **Just enough governance.** We value processes that ensure
    successful delivery and organisational buy-in.
